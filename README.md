# google-maps-typescript
a basic google maps address search we application using vanilla typescript

The key used in the api will no longer be active when this is pushed to github.

This is a very basic application that currently provides little to no feedback to the user should a search result not be found.

The purpose of this application was to learn some nuances in working with different libraries and api while working in typescript
